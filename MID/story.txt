Story Title: "The Day at the <place>"

Today I went to the <place> with my best friend, <person_name>.
We saw a <adjective> <animal> jumping over a <object>!
Then we decided to <verb> near the <another_place>,
but a <color> <monster> scared us away.
We ran as fast as our <body_part_plural> could carry us,
laughing and yelling, "<funny_phrase>!"
What a <adjective> day!
